5. Designing Java Stream Functionality and Understanding Functional Interfaces
   Java Streams:

Purpose: Provide a functional approach to processing sequences of elements with operations like filter, map, and collect.
Components:
Source: The initial data (e.g., collections, arrays).
Intermediate Operations: Operations that transform the stream (e.g., filter, map).
Terminal Operations: Operations that produce a result or side-effect (e.g., collect, forEach).
Key Functional Interfaces:

Predicate<T>:
Purpose: Represents a boolean-valued function of one argument.
Usage: Used in filter operations.
Function<T, R>:
Purpose: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
Usage: Used in map operations.
Consumer<T>:
Purpose: Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
Usage: Used in forEach operations.
Supplier<T>:
Purpose: Represents a supplier of results.
Usage: Used in generating streams.
Collector<T, A, R>:
Purpose: Represents a mutable reduction operation.
Usage: Used in collect operations to accumulate stream elements into a collection or other data structure.
Designing Stream-like Functionality:

Fluent API: Implement methods that return the stream instance to allow method chaining.
Lazy Evaluation: Ensure that intermediate operations are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked.
Parallel Processing: Support parallel execution of operations for performance optimization.
Example Functional Interfaces in Streams:

Filter:
java
Copy code
Stream<T> filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate);
Map:
java
Copy code
<R> Stream<R> map(Function<? super T, ? extends R> mapper);
Collect:
java
Copy code
<R, A> R collect(Collector<? super T, A, R> collector);
