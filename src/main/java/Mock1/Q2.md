2. Dependency Injection Lifecycle in Spring
   The lifecycle of a Spring bean involved in dependency injection typically follows these steps:

Instantiation: Spring creates an instance of the bean.
Populate Properties: Spring injects dependencies into the beanâ€™s properties (via constructor, setters, or field injection).
Bean Name Aware: If the bean implements BeanNameAware, Spring calls setBeanName().
Bean Factory Aware: If the bean implements BeanFactoryAware, Spring calls setBeanFactory().
Application Context Aware: If the bean implements ApplicationContextAware, Spring calls setApplicationContext().
Pre-Initialization: Beans can participate in pre-initialization steps via BeanPostProcessor.
Initialization: If the bean implements InitializingBean or has an init-method, Spring calls afterPropertiesSet() or the designated method.
Post-Initialization: Beans can participate in post-initialization steps via BeanPostProcessor.
Usage: The bean is ready to be used within the application.
Destruction: When the application context is closed, Spring calls destroy() for singleton beans implementing DisposableBean or having a destroy-method.

Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for managing resources, initializing connections, or performing cleanup tasks effectively.
