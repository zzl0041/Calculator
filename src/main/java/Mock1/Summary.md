Summary
Extensibility and DI: Use design patterns like Strategy and Factory to add new logic without hard-coding, leveraging Springâ€™s @Autowired for dependency injection while managing the bean lifecycle effectively.
Design Patterns: Utilize patterns such as Strategy, Factory, Chain of Responsibility, and others to build a modular and maintainable system.
Stream Functionality: Understand and implement Java Streams by leveraging functional interfaces like Predicate, Function, and Collector to enable operations like filter, map, and collect.
Key-Value DataStore: Design a thread-safe K-V store with essential CRUD operations, ensuring extensibility for transaction management.
Transaction Management: Implement transactions in the K-V store using thread-local storage to handle startTransaction(), commit(), and rollback() operations, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
