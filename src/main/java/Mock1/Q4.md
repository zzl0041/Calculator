4. Using the Chain Design Pattern in a Project
   Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

Objective: Decouple the sender of a request from its receivers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request.
Implementation Steps:
Handler Interface: Define an interface with a method to handle requests.
Concrete Handlers: Implement different handlers that process specific requests or pass them along the chain.
Chain Setup: Link handlers in a sequence where each handler has a reference to the next handler.

Benefits:

Flexibility: Easily add, remove, or reorder operations in the chain.
Decoupling: Handlers do not need to know about each other, promoting loose coupling.
Reusability: Handlers can be reused in different chains or contexts.
