1. Handling Addition of New Logic Without Hard-Coding and Using @Autowired for Dependency Injection in Spring
   Avoiding Hard-Coding and Static Methods:

Strategy Pattern: Implement different algorithms or behaviors encapsulated within separate classes. This allows adding new logic by simply introducing new strategy classes without modifying existing code.
Factory Pattern: Use factories to create instances of different classes based on input parameters or configuration, avoiding direct instantiation and hard-coding.
Using @Autowired for Dependency Injection (DI):

Component Scanning: Annotate your classes with @Component, @Service, @Repository, etc., to enable Spring to detect and manage them.

Constructor Injection: Prefer constructor-based injection for better immutability and easier testing.

java
@Service
public class CalculatorService {
private final OperationStrategy addOperation;

    @Autowired
    public CalculatorService(OperationStrategy addOperation) {
        this.addOperation = addOperation;
    }

    // Methods using addOperation
}
Avoiding Static Methods: Static methods are hard to test and cannot leverage DI. Instead, use instance methods managed by Spring beans.

Handling Spring Lifecycle:

Bean Initialization and Destruction: Utilize lifecycle callbacks like @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy for initialization and cleanup.
Scopes: Define appropriate bean scopes (singleton, prototype, etc.) based on the use case.
Proxying and AOP: Understand how Spring manages proxies, especially when using features like transactions or security.
Example Design Decision:

OperationStrategy Interface: Define an interface for operations.
Concrete Implementations: Create separate classes for each operation.
Dependency Injection: Inject these strategies into the Calculator class using @Autowired.
