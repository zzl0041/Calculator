3. Design Patterns Utilized
   In the context of building an extensible calculator and related functionalities, several design patterns are beneficial:

Strategy Pattern:

Purpose: Encapsulates algorithms or behaviors, allowing them to be interchangeable.
Usage: Define different operation strategies (Add, Subtract, Multiply, etc.) that implement a common interface.

Factory Pattern:

Purpose: Creates objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.
Usage: Use factories to instantiate different operation strategies based on input.

Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

Purpose: Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
Usage: Implement a chain of operations where each operation can decide to handle the request or pass it along.

Decorator Pattern:

Purpose: Adds behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
Usage: Enhance operations with additional features like logging, validation, or transaction management.

Singleton Pattern:

Purpose: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
Usage: Manage shared resources like the Calculator instance.

Observer Pattern:

Purpose: Allows objects to be notified of changes in other objects.
Usage: Implement event-driven features where operations can notify listeners upon execution.

Command Pattern:

Purpose: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing.
Usage: Represent operations as command objects that can be executed, undone, or queued.
